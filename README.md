## ‚ú® Key Features
* **Conversational AI:** A natural language chat interface to ask complex financial questions.
* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Answers are based on a custom, factual knowledge base, minimizing hallucinations and providing accurate information.
* **Expert Knowledge Base:** Loaded with detailed information on dozens of financial concepts (Credit Score, EMI, APR, LTV) and RBI guidelines (Fair Practices Code, Digital Lending Rules).
* **Advanced AI Persona:** Guided by a sophisticated system prompt to ensure responses are professional, empathetic, and follow a structured conversational flow.
* **Interactive UI:** A clean, tabbed Gradio interface that is intuitive and easy to use.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
* **Backend:** Python
* **AI & ML:** LangChain, Google Gemini (`gemini-1.5-flash`), FAISS (for vector storage)
* **UI:** Gradio

## üß† Project Architecture
The application uses a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline to provide accurate, context-aware answers:

1.  **Knowledge Base:** Text files containing financial concepts and RBI rules are loaded and split into chunks.
2.  **Vectorization:** The text chunks are converted into numerical vectors (embeddings) using Google's embedding model and stored in a FAISS vector store.
3.  **User Query:** When a user asks a question, their query is also converted into a vector.
4.  **Retrieval:** The FAISS vector store performs a similarity search to find the most relevant text chunks from the knowledge base.
5.  **Generation:** The original question, the retrieved context, and the advanced system prompt are passed to the Gemini LLM, which generates the final, accurate, and well-formatted answer.
